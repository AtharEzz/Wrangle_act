# Data analysis for [WeRateDogs](https://bit.ly/3oFyxDf)

###### This project is part of Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree. 

This project tackles data with different formats using three different ways of gathering:
1. Handed csv file (Twitter archive).
2. Givin URL to download a tsv file programmatically with the image predictions related to the previoud csv file.
3. Using Twitter API to download Json file and narrow down the data to the match the data included in the previous two files.


After gathering data successfully, I did assessment programmatically and visually to the datasets including my written observations which were divided into quality and tideness
to use it as a guide during the cleaning process.
The cleaning process was devided into three sub steps:
1. Define
2. Code 
3. Test

We were required to handle eight quality issues and two tideness.
After the cleaning, I merged the three datasets into one master dataset in csv format.

I performed analyses and visualizations to get insights about the dataset and I included my insights into the report_act.

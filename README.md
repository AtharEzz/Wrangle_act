# Data analysis for [WeRateDogs](https://bit.ly/3oFyxDf)

###### This project is part of Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree. 

This project tackles data with different formats using three different ways of gathering:
1. Handed CSV file (Twitter archive).
2. Given URL to download a tsv file programmatically with the image predictions related to the previous csv file.
3. Using Twitter API to download the JSON file and narrow the data to match the data included in the previous two files.


After gathering data successfully, I did an assessment programmatically and visually of the datasets including my written observations which were divided into quality and tidiness
to use it as a guide during the cleaning process.
The cleaning process was divided into three sub-steps:
1. Define
2. Code 
3. Test

We were required to handle eight quality issues and two tidiness.
After the cleaning, I merged the three datasets into one master dataset in CSV format.

I performed analyses and visualizations to get insights about the dataset and included my insights into the report_act.
